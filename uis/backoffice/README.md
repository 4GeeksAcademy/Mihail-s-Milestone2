# TrackFlow Operations Backoffice

An independently runnable internal operations entry view for the TrackFlow monorepo. It demonstrates a workspace shell and a searchable, filterable shipment activity table using local illustrative data.

## Demo data

All shipment rows and summary counts are illustrative examples implemented locally in `app.js`. This page has no API connection and does not display live company operations. Warehouse sites, destinations, and carriers use generic labels to keep sample records clearly illustrative; see `memory-bank/projectbrief.md` for the company facts.

## Technology

Static HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. No build step or package installation is needed. Fonts load from Google Fonts when a network connection is available; system fallbacks remain usable offline.

## Run

From the repository root:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8081 --directory uis/backoffice
```

Open `http://localhost:8081`.

## Current interactions

- Search sample rows by order ID, example brand, destination, or carrier.
- Filter sample rows by warehouse and shipment status.
- Use `/` to focus search and the refresh control to update the local display timestamp.
- Summary cards update with the active filters and count only the local sample records.
